# Releases

## Versioning

We try to follow the [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning scheme, which is mostly based on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Procedure

1. Add an entry in `CHANGELOG.md`. Remember to give thanks to all the contributors!
2. Use `tbump` to bump the version.
3. Edit the release in GitHub. Copy the changelog entry into its description
