All contributions are welcome!

* ask questions, report issues, ask for features or write anything message to the app authors - use **Issues** for all
of these,
* contribute to the documentation and example configuration - with **Pull Requests**, 
* contribute your bug fixes, new features, refactoring and other code improvements - with **Pull Requests**,

...and probably more! If you want to help in any way but don't know how - create an **Issue**.

## Issues

As the project is not (yet ;) flooded with issues the guidelines for creating them are not very strict
and should be very common sense ones.

### Questions

Before asking a question please make sure that you have read the docs, especially the example 
[config.yml](https://github.com/gdubicki/gitlabform/blob/main/config.yml).  


### Problems

Before reporting a problem please update GitLabForm to the latest version and check if the issue persists.

If it does then please try to report what environment you have, what you try to do, what you expect to happen
and what does in fact happen.

To be more specific please remember to:

* provide GitLab version,
* provide GitLabForm version,
* provide your Python version and Operating System,
* provide config in whole, or a relevant fragment (of course you can and should redact any values you need
to redact for privacy and security reasons),

### Feature requests

Please note that although we do accept feature requests we do not promise to fulfill them.

However, it's still worth creating an issue for this as it shows interest in given feature and that may be taken
into account by both existing app authors and new contributors when planning to implement something new.
