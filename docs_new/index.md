![GitLabForm logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gdubicki/gitlabform/main/docs/gitlabform-logo.png){ align=left } 
is a specialized "configuration as a code" tool for GitLab projects, groups and more
using hierarchical configuration written in YAML.


## Why?

* **Short and powerful syntax.** We provide a lot of features for your configurations (not programs!) thanks to the [hierarchical configuration with inheritance, merging/overwriting and additivity](main_concepts.md#hierarchical-merged-and-overridable-configuration) .
```yaml
  # configuration shared by all projects in this group...
  a_group/*:
    merge_requests:
      approvals:
        approvals_before_merge: 2
  # ...except this project that has a different config:
  a_group/a_special_project:
    merge_requests:
      approvals:
        approvals_before_merge: 1
```

* **Dynamic features.** GitLab has monthly releases, so it introduces new features that you can configure with API very often. GitLabForm can use them immediately because we use [passing the parameters as-is to GitLab APIs with PUT/POST requests](main_concepts.md#raw-parameters-passing).
```yaml
  a_group/a_project:
    project_settings:
      # ALL the keys described at
      # https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#edit-project
      # can be provided here
```

* **Stability.** We treat our users the way we would like to be treated by other software projects maintainers:
    * We follow [semver](https://semver.org/) and don't allow behavior _changes_ in minor or patch versions.
    * Before changing the syntax we start printing _deprecation warnings_ in the versions before.
    * We use _versioning of the configuration syntax_ for major changes.
